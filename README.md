* The game randomly shuffles the cards on page load, congratulations popup, and restart button

**Congratulations Popup**

* A modal appears to congratulate the player and ask if they want to play again. 
* A star rating should be present, and the amount of time to complete the game.

**Restart Button**

* A restart button allows the player to reset the game board, the timer, and the star rating.

**Star Rating**

* The game displays a star rating (from 1-3) that reflects the player's performance. At the beginning of a game, it should display 3 stars.
* After x number of moves, it should change to a 2 star rating. After a few more moves, it should change to a 1 star rating.

**Timer**

* When the player starts a game, a displayed timer should also start. Once the player wins the game, the timer stops.
